# Credit_Risk_Analysis

**Overview**

The purpose of this analysis was to use our knowledge of jupyter notebook and machine learning to mimic credit card risk through resampling models and algorithms. We were to evaluate different models within this credit card analysis with unbalanced classes that would allow us to compare the accurate results of credit card risk depending on the model we chose to use. We used a credit card dataset from LendingClub to compare two machine learning models that will reduce the amount of bias in the modeling process to predict credit risk more efficiently. 

**Results**

-The six models that were used in this preditions were the Naive Random Oversampling model, SMOTE oversampling, Undersampling, and a combination of over and undersampling. We also used two ensemble methods, balance random forest classifier and easy ensemble AdaBoost classifier. 

-For the resampling methods there was a pretty similar result in the balanced accuracy score based on the logistical regression
